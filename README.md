# seqDenoAntoencoder

Here is some code for tackling topic analysis task. That is, given a topic word and a bunch of text files, find the most relevant files with respect to the topic word.

I have used
* tfidf
* lad
* doc2vec (paragraph vector)
* average word embedding
* sequence denoising autoencoder

To use them, just run
### python xxx.py

It will print out the result.

Have fun.
